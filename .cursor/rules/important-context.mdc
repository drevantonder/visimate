- Readme.md contains saas idea, UX flow guidelines, in scope, out of scope
- Use `pnpm` to install node packages.
- We are using Nuxt in v4 mode: https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/upgrade#testing-nuxt-4
- Use NuxtUI and TailwindCSS for UI: https://ui.nuxt.com/getting-started
- Use Zod in /shared/schema for types and typesafety
- Avoid premature optimization and remember KISS (Keep it simple stupid)
- Prefer adding to pre-existing files, rather than creating new ones. Create new ones only if it absolutely makes sense.
- exported functions, variables in `utils` (in shared, app and server) are autoimported. No need to manually import.
- We intend to deploy this on Fly.io once development progresses far enough.
- Our database will be sqlite with drizzle and drizzle-kit for simplicity and typescript.
- Rely on convention over configuration to keep code shorter and have less complexity
- Prefer typescript inference
