# DoorDash Listing

Expand your restaurant's reach with DoorDash - America's leading food delivery platform connecting millions of hungry customers to local restaurants every day.

::tech-detail{summary="What we check for DoorDash presence"}
We verify if your business has an active DoorDash URL stored in our system. This indicates whether you've set up and maintained a presence on the DoorDash platform. DoorDash operates primarily in the United States, Canada, Australia, and Japan, with over 25 million customers and 500,000+ restaurant partners.
::

## What we're checking

We look for whether your restaurant or food business is listed and active on DoorDash's delivery platform. Being on DoorDash means customers can order your food for delivery through their app and website.

::impact{type="money" severity="high"}
**Restaurants on DoorDash see average revenue increases of 20-30%** from delivery orders, with peak times generating 40% more orders than dine-in alone.

## Problems This Check Identifies

### Missing Delivery Revenue Stream
Without DoorDash, you're missing out on the massive delivery market that has grown 300% since 2020.

### Limited Customer Reach
DoorDash customers who can't find you on the platform will order from competitors who are listed.

### Reduced Visibility During Peak Times
Evening and weekend delivery orders represent huge revenue opportunities that only reach listed restaurants.

### Competitive Disadvantage
Competitors on DoorDash capture market share while you rely solely on walk-in and pickup customers.

::example{type="bad" title="Local Pizza Shop - Missing DoorDash Revenue"}
Tony's Pizza had strong local walk-in business but wasn't on DoorDash. During COVID-19, while foot traffic dropped 60%, competitors on delivery platforms maintained revenue. After joining DoorDash, Tony's recovered and exceeded pre-pandemic revenue by 25% within 4 months.
