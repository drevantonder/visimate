# Website Consistency - NAP Matching

Ensure your business Name, Address, and Phone (NAP) information matches exactly between your website and Google Business Profile for maximum local search credibility and customer trust.

::tech-detail{summary="What we check for NAP consistency"}
We compare your business name, complete address, and phone number between your website and Google Business Profile to ensure they match exactly. NAP consistency is a crucial local SEO ranking factor - search engines use matching information across platforms to verify business legitimacy and determine local search rankings.
::

## What we're checking

We verify that your business name, address, and phone number are identical between your website and Google Business Profile listings.

::impact{type="customers" severity="high"}
**Inconsistent NAP information can reduce local search rankings by up to 40%**, and businesses with consistent information are 3x more likely to appear in local search results.
::

## Problems This Check Identifies

### Search Engine Trust Issues
Google views inconsistent business information as a sign of poor business management or potential fraud, lowering rankings.

### Customer Confusion and Frustration
Different contact information across platforms leaves customers unsure which details are correct.

### Reduced Local Search Visibility
Inconsistent NAP data prevents search engines from confidently displaying your business in local search results.

### Lost Citation Value
Online directories and reviews lose their SEO value when business information doesn't match your main listings.

::example{type="bad" title="Law Firm - Inconsistent Information Hurt Rankings"}
Legal Partners had "Smith & Associates Law Firm" on their website but "Smith and Associates" on Google (missing "Law Firm"). Their address showed "Suite 200" on the website but "Ste 200" on Google. These mismatches caused them to drop from #2 to #8 in "lawyers near me" searches, losing 60% of local search traffic.
