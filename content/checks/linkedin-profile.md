# LinkedIn Company Profile

Establish your business as a professional, credible company with a LinkedIn presence - the world's largest professional network with over 950 million members.

::tech-detail{summary="What we check for LinkedIn presence"}
We verify if your business has an active LinkedIn company profile URL stored in our system. This indicates whether you've created and maintained a professional presence on LinkedIn's platform. LinkedIn is essential for B2B businesses, service providers, and any company wanting to establish professional credibility.
::

## What we're checking

We look for whether your business has an active LinkedIn company page where potential clients, partners, and employees can learn about your company professionally.

::impact{type="customers" severity="medium"}
**80% of B2B leads come from LinkedIn**, and companies with active LinkedIn pages are 5x more likely to be considered credible by potential business clients.
::

## Problems This Check Identifies

### Limited Professional Credibility
Without LinkedIn, your business appears less established and professional to potential B2B clients and partners.

### Missed Networking Opportunities
LinkedIn is where business decisions makers connect - you're invisible to this crucial audience without a presence.

### Reduced Talent Attraction
Top talent often researches companies on LinkedIn before applying - missing profiles hurt recruitment efforts.

### Lost Thought Leadership
You can't establish expertise in your industry without sharing insights on the platform where professionals gather.

::example{type="bad" title="Marketing Agency - Missing LinkedIn Presence"}
Digital Solutions Agency was struggling to attract enterprise clients despite great work. Potential clients couldn't find them on LinkedIn, questioning their professional credibility. After creating a LinkedIn page and sharing industry insights, they landed 3 major enterprise contracts within 6 months.
