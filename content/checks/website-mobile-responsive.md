# Is mobile friendly

Your website must work perfectly on smartphones - over 60% of web traffic comes from mobile devices, and that number is even higher for local businesses.

::tech-detail{summary="How we detect mobile responsiveness"}
We scan your website's code for mobile-friendly indicators:
1. **Viewport meta tag** - Essential for proper mobile scaling
2. **Media queries** - CSS rules that adapt to screen sizes
3. **Responsive frameworks** - Bootstrap, Tailwind, Foundation, etc.
4. **Flexible layouts** - Using flexbox or CSS grid

A truly responsive site adjusts its layout, text size, and interactive elements to work perfectly on any screen size.
::

## What we're checking

We verify that your website automatically adapts to work well on smartphones and tablets, with readable text, easy-to-tap buttons, and proper scaling without horizontal scrolling.

::impact{type="customers" severity="high"}
**57% of users** won't recommend a business with a poorly designed mobile site, and **61% will leave** immediately if they can't find what they need
::

## What issues may it cause?

### Massive mobile traffic loss
- **73% of mobile users** encounter websites that are too slow or hard to use
- Google reports 61% leave if site isn't mobile-friendly
- Pinch-to-zoom frustrates users immediately
- Text too small to read drives visitors away

### Google ranking disaster
- **Mobile-first indexing** means Google primarily uses mobile version
- Non-responsive sites severely penalized in rankings
- Lose "mobile-friendly" label in search results
- Dropped from local "near me" searches on phones

### Lost business opportunities
- Can't capture impulse mobile shoppers
- Contact forms impossible to fill on phones
- Click-to-call buttons don't work properly
- Competitors with mobile sites win your customers

- 68% of website traffic was mobile but 90% bounced immediately
- Appointment form was unusable on phones
- Lost an estimated 45 new patients per month
- Younger patients chose mobile-friendly competitors
- Emergency appointment calls dropped 60%
Finally redesigned: $3,500 cost recovered in 6 weeks from new patients
