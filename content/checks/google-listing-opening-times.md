# Google Business Profile - Opening Hours

Help customers visit your business at the right time by clearly displaying your opening hours on Google - one of the most searched-for pieces of business information.

::tech-detail{summary="What we check for opening hours"}
We verify that your Google Business Profile has complete opening hours listed for each day of the week. This includes regular hours, holiday hours, and any special hours. Google uses this information to show when your business is open in search results and Maps, and to determine if you're "Open Now" or "Closed."

## What we're checking

We look for complete opening and closing times for each day of the week in your Google Business Profile. This includes handling of holidays, special hours, and temporary closures.

::impact{type="customers" severity="high"}
**76% of customers check business hours before visiting**, and businesses with accurate hours see 35% fewer "is this place open?" calls and negative reviews.
::

## Problems This Check Identifies

### Customer Frustration and Lost Sales
When hours aren't listed, customers may arrive to find you closed, leading to negative reviews and lost business.

### Missed "Open Now" Visibility
Google prominently displays "Open Now" in search results - without hours, you miss this valuable visibility boost.

### Increased Customer Service Burden
Missing hours means more phone calls asking "are you open?" instead of customers confidently visiting.

### Negative Review Risk
Customers who arrive during unlisted hours often leave negative reviews about "confusing hours" or "wasted trips."

::example{type="bad" title="Coffee Shop - Missing Hours Hurt Business"}
Bean There Caf√© had no opening hours on Google. Customers would arrive at 6 AM expecting coffee, only to find they opened at 7 AM. This led to 12 negative reviews in one month mentioning "unclear hours" and "wasted trip." Adding accurate hours immediately reduced these complaints.

::

::fix-step{number="3" title="Add Complete Weekly Schedule"}
