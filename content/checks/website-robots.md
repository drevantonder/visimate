# Website SEO - Search Engine Access

Ensure search engines can find and index your website by properly configuring your robots.txt file - blocking search engines accidentally can make your business invisible online.

::tech-detail{summary="What we check for search engine accessibility"}
We examine your website's robots.txt file (located at yoursite.com/robots.txt) to ensure it's not blocking search engines from accessing your homepage and important pages. The robots.txt file tells search engine crawlers which pages they can or cannot access. Misconfigured robots.txt files can accidentally prevent Google from indexing your entire website.
::

## What we're checking

We verify that your robots.txt file allows search engines to access and index your homepage and other important business pages.

::impact{type="customers" severity="high"}
**Websites accidentally blocked by robots.txt lose 100% of their organic search traffic**, making them effectively invisible to potential customers searching online.
::

## Problems This Check Identifies

### Complete Search Invisibility
If your homepage is blocked, customers won't find your business when searching for your services or products.

### Lost Organic Traffic
Blocked pages can't appear in Google search results, eliminating this crucial source of free website traffic.

### Competitive Disadvantage
While you're invisible in search results, competitors capture all the potential customers looking for your services.

### Wasted Marketing Efforts
Other marketing efforts that rely on people finding your website online become ineffective.

::example{type="bad" title="Law Firm - Accidentally Blocked from Google"}
Patterson & Associates had a developer who accidentally set their robots.txt to block all search engines during website maintenance. For three months, they received zero organic search traffic and lost an estimated 200 potential client inquiries before discovering the error.

## How to Fix This

::fix-step{number="1" title="Check Your Robots.txt File"}
Visit yourwebsite.com/robots.txt to see if the file exists and what rules are currently set.
::

::fix-step{number="2" title="Identify Problematic Rules"}
Look for lines like "Disallow: /" which block all pages, or specific blocks on your homepage or important pages.
::

::fix-step{number="3" title="Update Robots.txt Configuration"}
Modify or remove blocking rules that prevent search engines from accessing your business pages. Ensure "Allow: /" for your main content.
::

::fix-step{number="4" title="Test with Google Search Console"}
Use Google Search Console's robots.txt tester to verify that Googlebot can access your important pages.
::

::fix-step{number="5" title="Monitor Search Engine Indexing"}
Check that your pages start appearing in Google searches again and monitor for any new indexing issues.
