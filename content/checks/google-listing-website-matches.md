# Google Business Profile - Website Link Match

Ensure your Google Business Profile links to your correct website - mismatched URLs confuse customers and can send traffic to competitors or broken pages.

::tech-detail{summary="What we check for website link accuracy"}
We verify that the website URL in your Google Business Profile exactly matches your official business website. This includes checking for proper protocols (https://), correct domain spelling, and ensuring the link directs to your main business website rather than social media pages or third-party sites.
::

## What we're checking

We look for whether the website link in your Google Business Profile correctly points to your official business website with the exact URL you want customers to visit.

::impact{type="customers" severity="medium"}
**Wrong website links cause 15-20% of potential customers to leave immediately**, and businesses lose an average of 30 website visits per week from incorrect Google listing links.

## Problems This Check Identifies

### Lost Website Traffic
Incorrect links send potential customers to wrong websites, broken pages, or competitors' sites.

### Broken Customer Journey
Customers expecting to reach your business may encounter confusion or frustration with mismatched destinations.

### Missed Conversion Opportunities
Traffic meant for your website ends up elsewhere, reducing inquiries, sales, and lead generation.

### Professional Credibility Issues
Wrong links make your business appear unprofessional or poorly managed to potential customers.

Taste of Italy's Google profile linked to their old website that was no longer maintained. Customers couldn't find current menus or make reservations, leading to frustrated phone calls and lost online orders. The old site also had outdated hours, causing additional confusion.
