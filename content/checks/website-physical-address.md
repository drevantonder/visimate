# Website Contact - Physical Address Display

Build customer trust and improve local search rankings by prominently displaying your business address on your website where customers can easily find it.

::tech-detail{summary="What we check for address visibility"}
We scan your website's header, footer, contact page, and other prominent areas for your complete physical business address. This includes street address, city, state/province, and postal code. Search engines use this information to understand your business location for local search results, and customers need it to visit your physical location.
::

## What we're checking

We look for your complete business address displayed prominently on your website, typically in the header, footer, or contact section.

::impact{type="customers" severity="medium"}
**68% of customers check business addresses online before visiting**, and businesses with clear address information see 25% more foot traffic from their websites.
::

## Problems This Check Identifies

### Customer Navigation Difficulties
Without a visible address, potential customers can't easily find your physical location, leading to lost visits.

### Reduced Local Search Rankings
Google needs consistent address information to rank your business in "near me" and location-based searches.

### Trust and Credibility Issues
Missing addresses make businesses appear less legitimate or transparent to potential customers.

### Missed Local SEO Opportunities
Your website can't contribute to local search optimization without clear location information.

::example{type="bad" title="Dental Practice - Hidden Address Confusion"}
Bright Smile Dentistry had their address only on a hard-to-find contact page buried in their navigation. Patients frequently called asking for directions, and many gave up trying to find the location. New patient visits from their website dropped 30% compared to competitors with prominent address displays.

## How to Fix This

::fix-step{number="1" title="Choose Prominent Placement"}
Add your address to the website header (top of every page) or footer (bottom of every page) where it's visible site-wide.
::

::fix-step{number="2" title="Format Address Clearly"}
Use complete, properly formatted address: "123 Main Street, Suite 100, Cityville, State 12345" - include all components.
::

::fix-step{number="3" title="Make Address Clickable"}
Link your address to Google Maps or your preferred mapping service so customers can get directions with one click.
::

::fix-step{number="4" title="Add to Contact Page"}
Include a detailed address with map embed on your dedicated contact page for customers who need specific location information.
::

::fix-step{number="5" title="Ensure Mobile Visibility"}
