# Google Business Profile Listing

Your business needs to be on Google Maps and Search - this is how 90% of customers find local businesses today.

::tech-detail{summary="What exactly is a Google Business Profile?"}
Previously called "Google My Business", this is your free business listing that appears when people search for your business or related services on Google Search and Google Maps. It shows your hours, location, photos, reviews, and contact information.
::

## What we're checking

We verify if your business has been claimed and set up on Google's business platform. This check looks for a valid Google Place ID in our system, which confirms your business is properly registered with Google.

::impact{type="customers" severity="high"}
**97% of consumers** search online for local businesses - without a Google listing, you're invisible to them
::

## What issues may it cause?

### You're invisible to new customers
- When someone searches "coffee near me" or "plumber in [your city]", you won't appear
- Competitors with listings will capture **all** these ready-to-buy customers
- You miss out on Google's **5 billion** daily searches

### Lost credibility
- Customers expect to find legitimate businesses on Google
- No listing can make your business seem outdated or closed
- **88% of consumers** trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations

::example{type="bad" title="Real business impact"}
Sarah's Bakery didn't have a Google listing. A competitor 2 miles away was getting 50+ customer calls per week that should have gone to Sarah - simply because they appeared on Google Maps and Sarah didn't.
