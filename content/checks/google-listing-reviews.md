# Rating ≥ 4.0 and ≥ 20 reviews

Your Google reviews are your digital reputation - we check if you have enough positive reviews to build trust and attract new customers.

::tech-detail{summary="How we measure review performance"}
We check two critical metrics from your Google Business Profile:
1. **Average rating**: Must be 4.0 stars or higher (out of 5)
2. **Review count**: Must have at least 20 reviews

Both conditions must be met to pass this check. We pull this data directly from Google's API to ensure accuracy. Reviews are one of the strongest local ranking factors in Google's algorithm.
::

## What we're checking

We verify that your business has built sufficient social proof through Google reviews. Having both quality (high rating) and quantity (enough reviews) shows you're an established, trusted business.

::impact{type="customers" severity="high"}
**93% of consumers** read online reviews before visiting a business, and **89% won't consider** a business rated below 4 stars
::

## What issues may it cause?

### Massive customer loss
- **76% of consumers** trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations
- Businesses under 4 stars lose 70% of potential customers immediately
- Less than 20 reviews makes you look new or unpopular
- Customers choose competitors with better review profiles

### Google ranking penalty
- Reviews are a **top 3 local ranking factor**
- Low ratings push you down in "near me" searches
- Fewer reviews = less keyword content for Google
- Competitors with better reviews rank above you

### Trust and credibility crisis
- New customers question your quality
- Appears you don't care about customer feedback
- Makes price justification difficult
- Hurts word-of-mouth referrals

::example{type="bad" title="The review death spiral"}
Mike's Auto Repair had only 8 reviews with a 3.2 average:
- Lost 65% of phone calls after people checked reviews
- Dropped from #2 to #8 in local Google rankings
- Revenue declined 40% over 6 months
- Good customers didn't leave reviews, only angry ones did
- Competitor with 4.7 stars and 145 reviews dominated the market
