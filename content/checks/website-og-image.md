# Website Social - Open Graph Images

Make your website links look professional and attractive when shared on social media with properly configured Open Graph images that encourage clicks and engagement.

::tech-detail{summary="What we check for Open Graph image setup"}
We verify that your website pages include Open Graph image meta tags (`<meta property="og:image" content="...">`) in the HTML head section. These images appear as previews when your website links are shared on Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and other social platforms. Without them, social platforms may show generic placeholders or random images from your site.

## What we're checking

We look for properly configured Open Graph images that will display when your website links are shared on social media platforms.

::impact{type="customers" severity="low"}
**Posts with custom images receive 2.3x more engagement** on social media, and 65% of people are visual learners who respond better to image content.

## Problems This Check Identifies

### Poor Social Media Appearance
Without Open Graph images, your shared links may show blank previews, generic placeholders, or random unrelated images.

### Reduced Social Engagement
Plain text links without appealing images receive significantly fewer clicks and shares on social platforms.

### Missed Branding Opportunities
Every social share is a chance to showcase your brand visually - missing images waste this free marketing exposure.

### Unprofessional Social Presence
Businesses without proper social previews appear less established and tech-savvy to potential customers.

::example{type="bad" title="Bakery - Generic Social Shares"}
Sweet Dreams Bakery's website links shared on Facebook showed random text snippets with no images. When customers shared their cake photos, the bakery's website link looked unprofessional compared to competitors whose links showed beautiful cake images and branded graphics.
