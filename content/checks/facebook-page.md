# Has a Facebook page

Your business needs a Facebook presence - it's still the world's largest social network where customers expect to find and interact with local businesses.

::tech-detail{summary="How we detect Facebook pages"}
We check if your business has a Facebook username stored in our system. This indicates you've created and maintained a Facebook business page. Facebook Pages are different from personal profiles - they're specifically designed for businesses with features like insights, advertising, and customer messaging.
::

## What we're checking

We verify if your business has an active Facebook page that customers can find, follow, and interact with. This is your digital storefront on the world's most popular social platform.

::impact{type="customers" severity="high"}
**2.9 billion people** use Facebook monthly - and **66% follow or research local businesses** on the platform

## What issues may it cause?

### Invisible to social media users

- Customers assumed the original store had closed
- Lost 30% of foot traffic in 6 months
- Missed critical word-of-mouth during a town flood (competitor shared emergency supplies info)
