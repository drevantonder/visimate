# Website Accessibility - Proper Loading

Ensure your website loads properly for every visitor without error messages or broken pages that drive customers away from your business.

::tech-detail{summary="What we check for website loading status"}
We test your website's main URL to ensure it returns a successful HTTP status code (200-299 range). This means the page loads properly without server errors, broken links, or access issues. Status codes outside this range indicate problems like "404 Not Found," "500 Server Error," or "403 Forbidden" that prevent customers from reaching your business.
::

## What we're checking

We verify that your website loads successfully when customers try to visit it, without encountering error messages or technical problems.

::impact{type="customers" severity="high"}
**94% of customers will leave a website immediately if it shows error messages**, and a broken website can lose 40% of potential customers before they even learn about your business.
::

## Problems This Check Identifies

### Immediate Customer Loss
Error pages cause visitors to leave instantly, often never returning to try your website again.

### Damaged Professional Reputation
Broken websites make businesses appear unprofessional, outdated, or potentially out of business.

### Lost Sales and Inquiries
Every error page is a missed opportunity for customer contact, sales, or service requests.

### Search Engine Penalties
Google penalizes websites that frequently return errors, reducing your search visibility.

::example{type="bad" title="Plumbing Service - Broken Website Emergency"}
QuickFix Plumbing's website started showing "500 Internal Server Error" due to hosting issues. During a busy winter week with burst pipe emergencies, 200+ potential customers encountered the error page and called competitors instead. They lost an estimated $15,000 in emergency service calls.
