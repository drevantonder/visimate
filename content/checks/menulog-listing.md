## Problems This Check Identifies

### Missing Major Delivery Market
Without Menulog, you're invisible to millions of customers who primarily order food through delivery apps.

### Limited Evening and Weekend Revenue
Peak delivery times represent massive earning opportunities that only reach listed restaurants.

### Competitive Disadvantage in ANZ
Competitors on Menulog capture local market share while you miss out on the delivery boom.

### Reduced Visibility During Lockdowns
Delivery platforms become essential during events that limit dining out or foot traffic.

::example{type="bad" title="Thai Restaurant - Missing Menulog Orders"}
Bangkok Bites had excellent in-restaurant service but wasn't on Menulog. While competitors saw steady delivery orders during winter months and rainy days, their revenue dropped 35% during slower periods. After joining Menulog, they maintained consistent revenue year-round.
