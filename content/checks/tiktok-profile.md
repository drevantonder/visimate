## Problems This Check Identifies

### Missing Younger Demographics
Without TikTok, you're invisible to Gen Z and younger millennials who spend significant time on the platform.

### Lost Viral Marketing Opportunities
TikTok's algorithm can make content go viral overnight - missing potential massive exposure for your business.

### Reduced Social Proof
Younger customers expect brands to have a TikTok presence and may question credibility without one.

### Limited Creative Marketing Reach
TikTok's unique format allows for creative marketing that traditional platforms can't match.

::example{type="bad" title="Local Bakery - Missing TikTok Audience"}
Sweet Dreams Bakery had an aging customer base and declining sales. While they had Facebook and Instagram, they weren't on TikTok where younger customers were discovering local businesses. After creating TikTok showing baking processes, they gained 15,000 followers and saw a 40% increase in customers under 30.
