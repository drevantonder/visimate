Showcase your business expertise and build trust through YouTube - the world's second largest search engine with over 2 billion monthly active users.

## Problems This Check Identifies

### Missing Video Marketing Opportunities
Without YouTube, you can't leverage the power of video marketing, which converts 80% better than text content.

### Reduced Search Engine Visibility
YouTube videos often rank high in Google searches - missing this SEO opportunity hurts your overall online presence.

### Limited Trust Building
Customers can't see your expertise, products in action, or behind-the-scenes authenticity that builds trust.

### Competitive Disadvantage
Competitors with YouTube channels appear more established and credible to potential customers.

::example{type="bad" title="Home Renovation Company - Missing Video Proof"}
BuildRight Renovations struggled to convince potential clients of their quality work. Without video testimonials or project showcases, customers chose competitors who had YouTube channels showing their work. After starting YouTube, they increased project inquiries by 200% within 6 months.
