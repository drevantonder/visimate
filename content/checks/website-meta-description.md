# Website SEO - Meta Descriptions

Attract more clicks from search results with compelling meta descriptions that clearly explain what your business offers to potential customers.

::tech-detail{summary="What we check for meta description optimization"}
We verify that your website pages include meta description tags (`<meta name="description" content="...">`) with concise, relevant descriptions under 160 characters. Meta descriptions appear as the snippet text under your page title in Google search results and significantly influence whether people click through to your website.
::

## What we're checking

We look for well-written meta descriptions on your key pages that accurately describe your business and encourage potential customers to click through from search results.

::impact{type="customers" severity="medium"}
**Good meta descriptions can increase click-through rates by 5-15%** from search results, while missing descriptions cause Google to auto-generate often unhelpful snippets.
::

## Problems This Check Identifies

### Poor Search Result Appearance
Without meta descriptions, Google creates generic snippets that may not accurately represent your business.

### Lower Click-Through Rates
Boring or missing descriptions fail to entice potential customers to click on your website in search results.

### Missed Marketing Opportunities
Every search result is a free advertisement - poor descriptions waste this valuable exposure.

### Competitive Disadvantage
Competitors with compelling descriptions will attract more clicks from the same search results.

::example{type="bad" title="Accounting Firm - Generic Search Snippets"}
NumberCrunch Accounting had no meta descriptions, so Google showed random text from their pages like "Welcome to our website. We provide services..." instead of their expertise in small business taxes. Competitors with clear descriptions like "Expert small business tax preparation - save money and time" received more clicks.
