# Deliveroo Listing

Get your food business on Deliveroo's platform - one of the UK's leading food delivery services with millions of hungry customers.

::tech-detail{summary="What we check for Deliveroo presence"}
We verify if your business has an active Deliveroo URL stored in our system. This indicates whether you've set up and maintained a presence on the Deliveroo platform. Deliveroo operates primarily in the UK, Ireland, France, Belgium, Italy, Australia, the Netherlands, Hong Kong, Singapore, UAE, and Kuwait.
::

## What we're checking

We look for whether your restaurant or food business is listed and active on Deliveroo's delivery platform. Being on Deliveroo means customers can order your food for delivery or pickup through their app and website.

A popular local Thai restaurant resisted joining Deliveroo for 2 years. When they finally joined:
- First month: 340 new customers who'd never visited in person
- Average order value 25% higher than dine-in
- Discovered their pad thai was their most popular delivery item (not their in-house bestseller)
- Estimated Â£15,000 in monthly revenue they'd been missing
