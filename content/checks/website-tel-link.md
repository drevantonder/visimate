# Website Usability - Click-to-Call Links

Make it effortless for mobile visitors to call your business with clickable phone numbers - a simple feature that can significantly increase customer inquiries and sales.

::tech-detail{summary="What we check for clickable phone links"}
We verify that phone numbers on your website use proper "tel:" links (`<a href="tel:+15551234567">555-123-4567</a>`). This HTML markup makes phone numbers clickable on mobile devices, allowing customers to call your business with a single tap rather than manually dialing the number.
::

## What we're checking

We look for properly formatted click-to-call links on your phone numbers that allow mobile users to instantly call your business with one tap.

::impact{type="customers" severity="medium"}
**Click-to-call features increase phone inquiries by 30-50%** on mobile devices, and 73% of customers prefer calling businesses rather than filling out contact forms.
::

## Problems This Check Identifies

### Lost Mobile Conversion Opportunities
Mobile users can't easily call your business, leading to missed sales and inquiry opportunities.

### Poor Mobile User Experience
Customers must manually copy and dial numbers, creating friction that often results in abandoned contact attempts.

### Competitive Disadvantage
Competitors with click-to-call links capture customers who want immediate phone contact.

### Reduced Emergency or Urgent Inquiries
Time-sensitive customers (plumbing emergencies, medical needs, etc.) may choose businesses they can contact immediately.

::example{type="bad" title="Emergency Plumber - Lost Urgent Calls"}
FastFix Plumbing displayed their phone number as plain text on their website. During a winter pipe-burst emergency, a homeowner found them on mobile but couldn't quickly call because the number wasn't clickable. They called a competitor with a clickable number instead, losing a $1,200 emergency service call.

## How to Fix This

::fix-step{number="1" title="Identify All Phone Numbers"}
Find every location on your website where your phone number appears: header, footer, contact page, service pages, etc.
::

::fix-step{number="2" title="Update HTML with Tel Links"}
Change phone number text to clickable links: `<a href="tel:+15551234567">(555) 123-4567</a>`. Include country code (+1 for US/Canada).
::

::fix-step{number="3" title="Use CMS Phone Number Features"}
If using WordPress, Shopify, or other platforms, use phone number widgets or plugins that automatically create click-to-call functionality.
::

::fix-step{number="4" title="Style Links Appropriately"}
Make clickable phone numbers visually obvious - use button styling, icons, or clear formatting so users know they're clickable.
::

::fix-step{number="5" title="Test on Mobile Devices"}
Visit your website on different mobile devices and test that tapping phone numbers opens the phone dialer correctly.
