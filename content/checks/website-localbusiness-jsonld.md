# Website SEO - Local Business Schema

Help search engines understand your business details with structured data markup that can improve local search visibility and enable rich search result features.

::tech-detail{summary="What we check for LocalBusiness structured data"}
We verify that your website includes JSON-LD structured data using the LocalBusiness schema (schema.org/LocalBusiness). This markup provides search engines with detailed information about your business including name, address, phone number, hours, services, and more in a standardized format that helps with local search optimization and rich snippets.
::

## What we're checking

We look for properly implemented LocalBusiness structured data on your website that helps search engines understand and display your business information.

::impact{type="customers" severity="medium"}
**Websites with LocalBusiness schema see 15-30% improvements in local search visibility** and are more likely to appear in Google's local pack and knowledge panels.
::

## Problems This Check Identifies

### Missed Local Search Opportunities
Without structured data, search engines may not fully understand your business type, location, and services for local search results.

### Reduced Rich Snippet Eligibility
Your business can't appear with enhanced search result features like star ratings, hours, or direct contact buttons.

### Lower Search Engine Confidence
Search engines have less certainty about your business details, potentially affecting local ranking algorithms.

### Competitive Disadvantage
Businesses with proper schema markup have advantages in local search results and rich snippet displays.

::example{type="bad" title="Dental Practice - Invisible in Local Search"}
Bright Smile Dentistry had a good website but no structured data. They rarely appeared in the local pack for "dentist near me" searches, even though they had excellent reviews. Competitors with LocalBusiness schema consistently outranked them in local search results.
