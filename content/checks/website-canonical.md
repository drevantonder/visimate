# Website SEO - Canonical URLs

Help search engines understand which version of your web pages to prioritize by setting canonical URLs - preventing duplicate content issues that can hurt your search rankings.

::tech-detail{summary="What we check for canonical URL implementation"}
We verify that your website pages include canonical link tags (`<link rel="canonical" href="...">`) in the HTML head section. Canonical tags tell search engines which version of a page is the "official" one when multiple URLs might show similar content. This is crucial for SEO because it prevents search engines from seeing duplicate content penalties.
::

## What we're checking

We look for proper canonical URL tags on your website pages that clearly specify the preferred version of each page for search engines.

::impact{type="customers" severity="low"}
**Websites without canonical URLs can lose 15-25% of their search rankings** due to duplicate content confusion, reducing organic traffic from potential customers.
::

## Problems This Check Identifies

### Search Engine Confusion
Without canonical tags, Google may not know which version of your pages to index and rank in search results.

### Duplicate Content Penalties
Search engines may penalize your site if they detect multiple URLs with identical or very similar content.

### Weakened Page Authority
Link authority gets split between duplicate URLs instead of concentrating on your preferred page version.

### Reduced Search Visibility
Your website may rank lower in search results due to technical SEO issues that are easy to fix.

::example{type="bad" title="E-commerce Store - Duplicate Content Issues"}
TechGear Shop had product pages accessible through multiple URLs (with/without www, with tracking parameters, etc.). Google couldn't determine which was the "real" page, so their product pages ranked poorly. Search traffic was 40% below competitors until they implemented canonical tags.

## How to Fix This

::fix-step{number="1" title="Identify Your Preferred URLs"}
Decide on the standard format for your URLs (with or without www, with https, etc.) that you want search engines to prioritize.
::

::fix-step{number="2" title="Add Canonical Tags to Pages"}
Insert `<link rel="canonical" href="https://yoursite.com/page-url">` in the HTML head section of each page, pointing to the preferred URL.
::

::fix-step{number="3" title="Use CMS or Plugin Solutions"}
If using WordPress, Shopify, or other CMS platforms, install SEO plugins like Yoast or RankMath that automatically add canonical tags.
::

::fix-step{number="4" title="Handle Parameter URLs"}
Set canonical tags for pages with tracking parameters, filters, or sorting options to point back to the clean main URL.
::

::fix-step{number="5" title="Test Implementation"}
Use Google Search Console or online tools to verify that canonical tags are properly implemented across your site.

## Benefits of Proper Canonical URLs

### Improved Search Rankings
Clear page prioritization helps search engines rank your preferred pages higher

### Consolidated Link Authority
All link value concentrates on your canonical pages instead of being split across duplicates

### Better Search Engine Understanding
Clear signals help Google properly index and display your pages in search results

### Prevention of SEO Penalties
Avoid duplicate content issues that can hurt your overall search performance

::example{type="good" title="Local Service Business - SEO Improvement"}
HomeFix Repairs added canonical tags to their service pages that were accessible through multiple category URLs. Within two months, their "plumbing repair" page moved from page 3 to position 2 in Google searches, increasing service calls by 60%.
