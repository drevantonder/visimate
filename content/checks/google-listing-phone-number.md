# Google Business Profile - Phone Number Match

Ensure your phone number is consistent between your Google Business Profile and website - mismatched contact information confuses customers and hurts your search rankings.

::tech-detail{summary="What we check for phone number consistency"}
We compare the phone number listed in your Google Business Profile with the phone number displayed on your website. We check for exact matches including formatting (parentheses, dashes, spaces). Google uses consistent business information across platforms as a ranking factor, and mismatched data can hurt local search performance.

## What we're checking

We verify that the phone number in your Google Business Profile exactly matches the phone number displayed on your website, ensuring customers get consistent contact information.

**Inconsistent contact information reduces customer trust by 25%** and can cause Google to lower your local search rankings due to conflicting business data.

## Problems This Check Identifies

### Customer Confusion and Frustration
Different phone numbers across platforms lead to confusion about which number is correct for reaching your business.

### Missed Customer Calls
Customers might call an outdated number from your website while your Google listing shows a different number.

### Reduced Search Engine Trust
Google views inconsistent business information as a sign of poor business management, potentially lowering your rankings.

### Lost Lead Opportunities
Potential customers may give up trying to contact you if they encounter conflicting phone numbers.

::example{type="bad" title="Law Firm - Phone Number Confusion"}
Legal Solutions had their old office number (555-1234) on their website but updated Google with their new number (555-5678). Potential clients would call the website number, get disconnected, then not try the Google number. They lost an estimated 15 consultation requests before fixing the mismatch.
