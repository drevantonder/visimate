# Google Business Profile - Primary Category

Set the right primary category for your business to ensure you appear in relevant searches and attract the right customers looking for exactly what you offer.

::tech-detail{summary="What we check for primary category"}
We verify that your Google Business Profile has a primary category selected that accurately describes your main business focus. The primary category is the most important classification Google uses to determine when and where to show your business in search results. It affects which searches trigger your listing and what features are available in your profile.

## What we're checking

We look for whether your Google Business Profile has an appropriate primary category that accurately represents your main business type and services.

## Problems This Check Identifies

### Appearing in Wrong Searches
Without a proper category, you might show up for irrelevant searches while missing your target customers.

### Reduced Search Visibility
Google may not understand what your business does, leading to lower rankings for relevant searches.

### Missing Category-Specific Features
Certain categories unlock special features like appointment booking, menu displays, or service area settings.

### Customer Confusion
Unclear categorization makes it harder for customers to understand what you offer at first glance.

::example{type="bad" title="Auto Repair Shop - Wrong Category Confusion"}
Fix-It Auto was categorized as "General Contractor" instead of "Auto Repair Shop." They appeared in searches for home renovation but not car repairs. After correcting to "Auto Repair Shop," relevant search visibility increased 300% and they gained access to automotive-specific features.
