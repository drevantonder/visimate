# Website Content - Menu Page

Help hungry customers discover your delicious offerings with a dedicated menu page that showcases your food, prices, and specialties in an appetizing, easy-to-browse format.

::tech-detail{summary="What we check for menu page presence"}
We scan your website for a dedicated menu page, typically found at URLs like /menu, /food-menu, or similar paths. We look for organized food and drink listings with descriptions, prices, and categories. For food businesses, a proper menu page is essential for customer decision-making and online ordering.

## What we're checking

We look for a dedicated menu page on your restaurant or food business website that clearly displays your food offerings, prices, and descriptions.

::impact{type="money" severity="high"}
**Restaurants with detailed online menus see 30% more advance orders** and customers spend 23% more when they can browse menu options before arriving.

## Problems This Check Identifies

### Customer Decision Paralysis
Without seeing your menu online, potential customers can't decide if they want to visit or order from your restaurant.

### Lost Pre-Visit Planning
Customers increasingly want to review menus, prices, and options before choosing where to dine or order food.

### Reduced Online Ordering
Food delivery and pickup customers need to see your full menu to place orders through your website.

### Competitive Disadvantage
Customers will choose restaurants where they can preview the menu over those where they can't see food options.

::example{type="bad" title="Italian Restaurant - Hidden Menu Costs Orders"}
Roma's Kitchen had amazing pasta dishes but no online menu. Customers would call asking about options and prices, taking up staff time. Many hung up when told "you can see the menu when you arrive." After competitors with online menus captured delivery orders, they realized the menu page was essential.

## Benefits of Dedicated Menu Page

Customers feel comfortable visiting or ordering when they know exactly what you offer and at what price

### Higher Average Order Value
When customers can browse and plan their orders, they often add appetizers, drinks, or desserts

### Reduced Phone Inquiries
Staff can focus on food preparation and service instead of answering menu questions

### Better Online Ordering Experience
Customers can easily place delivery or pickup orders through your website

::example{type="good" title="Pizza Restaurant - Menu Page Drives Orders"}
