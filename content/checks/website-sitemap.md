# Website SEO - XML Sitemap

Help search engines discover all your important pages with an XML sitemap - making it easier for Google to index your entire website and improve your search visibility.

::tech-detail{summary="What we check for sitemap presence"}
We verify that your website has an XML sitemap file accessible at common locations like yoursite.com/sitemap.xml or listed in your robots.txt file. XML sitemaps are structured files that list all your website pages, helping search engines understand your site structure and discover content they might otherwise miss during crawling.
::

## What we're checking

We look for an accessible XML sitemap that helps search engines efficiently discover and index all your important business pages.

::impact{type="customers" severity="low"}
**Websites with XML sitemaps are indexed 50% faster** by search engines, and pages are 30% more likely to be discovered compared to sites without sitemaps.
::

## Problems This Check Identifies

### Incomplete Search Engine Discovery
Without a sitemap, search engines might miss important pages on your website, reducing your overall search visibility.

### Slower Indexing of New Content
New pages and updates take longer for search engines to discover and include in search results.

### Poor Site Structure Understanding
Search engines may not fully understand your website organization, potentially affecting how pages rank.

### Missed SEO Opportunities
Important pages that aren't indexed can't appear in search results, losing potential customer traffic.

::example{type="bad" title="Service Business - Hidden Pages"}
GreenClean Services had detailed service pages for each cleaning type, but no sitemap. Google only found their homepage and contact page, missing 15 specialized service pages. Potential customers searching for "commercial cleaning" or "post-construction cleanup" never found them.
