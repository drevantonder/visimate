# Website loads quickly

Your website needs to load fast - we check if customers can see your content within 3 seconds, because that's when most people give up and leave.

::tech-detail{summary="Technical details: Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) measurement"}
We use Google's Core Web Vitals to measure your site's performance. Specifically, we check the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) - this measures when the main content (biggest image or text block) becomes visible. Google uses two data sources:
1. **Chrome User Experience Report (CrUX)** - Real user data from Chrome browsers
2. **PageSpeed Insights** - Simulated tests when real data isn't available

A good LCP score is under 2.5 seconds, acceptable is under 4 seconds, and anything over 4 seconds is considered poor.

## What we're checking

We measure how long real visitors wait before they can see and use your website's main content. Think of it like the time between opening your shop door and customers being able to see your products.

::impact{type="money" severity="high"}
**Amazon found that every 100ms of delay cost them 1% in sales.** For a small business making $100k/year online, a 1-second delay could mean $7,000 in lost revenue.
::

## What issues may it cause?

### Massive customer loss
- **53% of mobile visitors** leave if a page takes over 3 seconds
- **Every 1-second delay** reduces conversions by 7%
- On mobile networks, slow sites are even more frustrating
- Customers won't wait - they'll go to faster competitor sites

### Google ranking penalty
- **Speed is a ranking factor** since 2010 (mobile since 2018)
- Slow sites rank lower in search results
- Lower rankings = less traffic = fewer customers
- Google shows speed warnings for very slow sites

### Damaged reputation
- Users perceive slow sites as unprofessional or insecure
- **79% of customers** won't return to a slow site
- Negative word-of-mouth spreads quickly

::example{type="bad" title="Real cost of slow loading"}
A local furniture store's website took 8.5 seconds to load. Analytics showed:
- 68% bounce rate (people leaving immediately)
- Average of 112 lost customers per week
- Estimated $8,400 monthly revenue loss
After fixing speed issues, their sales increased by 34% in 3 months.

## How can I fix it?

::fix-step{number="1" title="Test your current speed"}
1. Visit [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev)
2. Enter your website URL and click "Analyze"
3. Look for your Performance score (aim for 90+)
4. Check the "Largest Contentful Paint" metric specifically
::

::fix-step{number="2" title="Fix images (biggest impact)"}
Images cause 80% of speed problems. Your web developer should:
- **Resize images** to actual display size (not 4000px wide for a 400px space)
- **Compress images** using tools like TinyPNG
- **Use modern formats** like WebP (30% smaller than JPEG)
- **Implement lazy loading** so images load as users scroll
::

::fix-step{number="3" title="Upgrade your hosting"}
Cheap hosting = slow website. Consider:
- **Business hosting** (from $20-50/month) vs shared hosting ($5/month)
- **SSD storage** for 3x faster file loading
- **CDN service** like Cloudflare (free tier available)
- **Server location** close to your customers
::

::fix-step{number="4" title="Optimize the code"}
Have your developer:
- **Minify CSS/JavaScript** (removes unnecessary characters)
- **Enable compression** (GZIP reduces file sizes by 70%)
- **Remove unused plugins** and scripts
- **Enable browser caching** so repeat visitors load faster

::time-estimate{minutes="240" difficulty="medium"}
Basic optimizations: 2-4 hours
Full optimization with hosting change: 1-2 days
