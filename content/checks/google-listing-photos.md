## Problems This Check Identifies

### Reduced Click-Through Rates
Listings without photos are often overlooked by potential customers browsing search results and Google Maps.

### Lower Customer Confidence
Without visual proof of your business quality, customers are hesitant to visit or make contact.

### Missed "Visual First" Customers
Many customers, especially younger demographics, make decisions based primarily on visual appeal.

### Competitive Disadvantage
Businesses with photo galleries appear more established and trustworthy compared to those without images.

::example{type="bad" title="Hair Salon - No Photos, No Customers"}
Style Studio had excellent reviews but no photos on Google. Potential clients couldn't see the salon's modern interior or stylists' work quality. After competitors with photo galleries attracted their customers, they realized photos were essential for the beauty industry.
