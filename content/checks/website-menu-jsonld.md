# Menu structured data (JSON-LD)

Help Google understand your menu items with structured data - so hungry customers can find exactly what they're craving before they even visit your website.

::tech-detail{summary="What is Menu JSON-LD structured data"}
JSON-LD (JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data) is code that helps search engines understand your menu items. We scan your menu pages for structured data that includes:
- Menu item names and descriptions  
- Prices and dietary information
- Categories and sections
- Images and preparation details

When implemented correctly, Google can display your menu items directly in search results, making it easier for customers to find specific dishes.
::

## What we're checking

We verify that your menu pages include properly formatted structured data that tells search engines about your food items, prices, and descriptions.

::impact{type="customers" severity="medium"}
Restaurants with menu structured data see **35% more clicks** from food-related searches and appear in Google's **"Order Food Near Me"** features
::

## What issues may it cause?

### Invisible menu in search results
- Your delicious dishes won't appear when people search for specific foods
- Lost opportunities from customers craving exactly what you serve
- Missing from Google's food ordering features
- No rich snippets showing prices and descriptions

::example{type="bad"}
**Without structured data**: Customer searches "chicken tikka masala near me" - your restaurant doesn't appear even though it's your specialty dish.
::

::example{type="good"}  
**With structured data**: Same search shows your restaurant with "Chicken Tikka Masala - $16.99" directly in Google results.
::

## How to fix this

::

::fix-step{number="4"}

::
